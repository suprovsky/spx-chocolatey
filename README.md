StorageCraft ShadowProtect SPX is the latest sector-based backup and disaster recovery product from StorageCraft. SPX delivers major benefits for:

- Annual Subscription Licensing  
SPX offers additional licensing options, with one-year, or two-year subscriptions and maintenance. Included with each license is access to updates, upgrades, and standard technical support during the subscription period.

- Socket Licensing  
Socket Licensing provides a much more flexible and cost-effective method of licensing SPX for VM environments.

- Single Pane Management  
Using ShadowControl 4.3 or newer for both Linux and Windows.

- Linux server support  
SPX supports Ubuntu 14.04, 16.04, and 18.04; CentOS/Red Hat RHEL 6 and 7.

- Windows Support  
SPX supports current Server and Desktop releases including Windows 10.

- New User Interface  
SPX offers an improved user interface that is more intuitive and easier to use. This interface displays a patented interactive timeline of existing backups. Select any backup to view a summary of that backup, including the backup file size.

- Single install for both Perpetual and MSP licenses  

- Flexible backup job scheduler  
SPX offers a predefined backup job profile for each backup type. Users can also customize their own, creating backups at the date and time the user wants.

- Remote Monitoring  
SPX has the ability to remotely monitor backups running on other SPX systems. This functionality is similar to the Management Console in ShadowProtect 5. SPX can serve as a remote console for other machines also running SPX. SPX provides all options available locally to the remote systems via the management connection. This remote connection leverages HTTP, rather than DCOM (as used by ShadowProtect). This means that most firewalls allow the SPX connection without the changes required for DCOM.

- Fully integrated with StorageCraft technology  
SPX uses the same backup file format as other ShadowProtect products. This means that ImageManager, Cloud Services, and ShadowProtect functions such as Mount, Verify, and VirtualBoot fully support both Linux-sourced backups as well as Windows.

- SPX is a native 64-bit application  

- VirtualBoot support for Linux  
SPX supports VirtualBoot for Linux system volume backups.

- VirtualBoot support for hypervisors.  
ShadowProtect SPX can VirtualBoot backup images in Microsoft Hyper-V, Oracle VirtualBox, and VMware vSphere. You can also right-click on an image to VirtualBoot.

- Unique SPX Codes for Windows Logs  
SPX events now display unique codes for Windows system logs. This simplifies searches and sorts for SPX issues.

- Changing Backup Destinations  
Users can now change an existing backup job's destination as storage needs change.

- Job Specific Logging  
SPX has improved logging that lets you analyze log information for a specific job. You can now open the log file from within the user interface.
